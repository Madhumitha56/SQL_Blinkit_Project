# ðŸ“Š BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing retail grocery sales data from BlinkIT using SQL in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The dataset includes product details, outlet information, item visibility, sales figures, and ratings.

I performed complete **data cleaning, KPI generation, grouping, pivoting, filtering**, and **window functions** to derive meaningful insights and visual summaries for business decisions.
